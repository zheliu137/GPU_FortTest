In this example, we call CUDA Fortran functions, MPI functions, and use OpenMP directives in one Fortran program.

The Fortran code is compiled with Intel Fortran compiler and the CUDA Fortran code is compiled by Nvidia Fortran compiler.

Can not use modules between different compilers. The .mod file can only be used in files compiled with same compiler.
